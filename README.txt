VietTravel - Simple static website (sample)
-----------------------------------------
Files included:
- index.html : single-page static site (open in browser)

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in your browser (double-click) OR serve it with a static server:
   - Using Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000
3. To deploy: upload the files to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting).

Notes:
- This is a demo, booking & payment are simulated client-side.
- If you want a deployable repo (with CI, domain, backend), tell me which provider you'd like and I can prepare steps.
